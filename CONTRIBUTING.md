# Contributing

This document outlines how you can contribute to the Grade Nudge project.

## Instructors of all levels

The best contribution an instructor can provide is using Grade Nudge and advocating for it in your school or university.  The end goal of the Grade Nudge project is to improve education.  Grade Nudge improves student performance through its use by instructors.  Some ideas:

1. Run training sessions at your school or university
2. Make training videos specific to your university’s or school’s LMS
3. Integrate it into course redevelopment plans

## Contributing to the Code Base

If you want to contribute a bug fix or a feature to the code base, this involves four steps.  

1. Before putting in effort, e-mail Ben Smith at ben@bensresearch.com the reason for the submission.  If this is a bug fix, this is self-explanatory.  However, if this is a feature addition, it may not be obvious all the consequences of the change and if it makes sense for the project.
2. Review the existing code in the repository.  While we don’t have a strict style guide, please match the general conventions in the code.
3. Clone the repository and make the changes
4. Create a pull request fully explaining the change

## Other ways to contribute

If you want to help the project in other ways, such as documentation, please reach out to Ben Smith at ben@bensresearch.com.
